************************** The Lead Management System ***********************************************************************************

	1.1 Leads

	The system will be used for capturing, managing, distributing and producing reports on leads.

	A Lead comprises of a combination of information that will be of interest to a Lead Buyer. A Lead Buyer will use the information
	in a Lead for some sort of gain, which may include selling a product to an interested party.

	A Lead will always have a Lead Type. 
	A Lead Type can have one or many Lead Attributes that will be specific to that type.
	A Lead Attribute will always be associated with one Lead Type.

	Each lead inserted into the system will be associated with a Lead Suplier. 
	This could be a company, a person, an organisation; basically some entity that will claim ownership for submitting the lead. 

	A Lead will be associated with a Lead Source which will store information regarding where the lead originated. 

	On lead creation, the Lead API will return a response indicating if the lead is valid or invalid.

	Each lead will have a detailed audit log that can be used to look up a history of all events and processing associated with a lead.

	1.2 Users

	A User will always be associated with a unique email address.

	1.3 Buyers

	A buyer will be associated with one or many products.
	A buyer will have a lead delivery schedule per product.
	A buyer will have a lead delivery mechanism which is configurable via the LeadsCRM. 
	It should be possible to deliver leads via HTTP POST and email.


	1.4 Landing Page Client

	1.4.1 The landing page client should be able to make a request to the API and retrieve a partially filled representation of a lead that it 
	can complete and send back. This will reduce the need to set hardcoded field values on the client (eg. LeadType Id)

	1.4.2 The partial lead retrieval endpoint will use the landing page domain and path of landing page to identify what kind of partial lead to send back.

	1.4.3 The request to the partial lead retrieval endpoint will be done asynchronously and will not have any impact on client page load. By the time
	the user has filled in the form the partial lead will be ready to be updated with field values the user has entered.

	1.4.4 Updating the partial lead with values submitted by the user will be the final step in the process before submitting the lead to the API.

	1.4.5 Try and perform as many validations as possible before capturing the lead (eg. Phone validations, duplicate checks).
